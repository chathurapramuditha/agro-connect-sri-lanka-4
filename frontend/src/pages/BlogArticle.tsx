The evidence from successful countries demonstrates that sustained agricultural investment pays dividends in economic growth, poverty reduction, food security, and environmental sustainability. Sri Lanka has the knowledge, experience, and potential to achieve similar transformation, but only with adequate investment and political commitment.

**Key imperatives for Budget 2025**:
- **Reverse the declining investment trend** with substantial budget increases
- **Focus on productivity and climate resilience** as primary objectives
- **Ensure inclusive growth** that benefits all farmers, especially smallholders
- **Build strong institutions** capable of effective program implementation
- **Create sustainable financing** mechanisms for long-term transformation

The agricultural sector employs over 25% of Sri Lanka's workforce and remains the backbone of rural economies. Continued neglect risks food security, rural poverty persistence, and missed opportunities for economic growth. Budget 2025 must signal a renewed commitment to agricultural transformation as a cornerstone of national development strategy.

The choice is clear: invest adequately in agriculture now, or face escalating costs of food insecurity, rural poverty, and economic stagnation in the future. For the sake of millions of farming families and the nation's long-term prosperity, Budget 2025 must prioritize agricultural transformation with the urgency and resources it deserves.
